1) Debug Testing for triangletype_err1.c

Line 118: (a+b < c) - This should be a+b <= c. Found it by reading the error output
		      of "%.5f + %.5f <= %.5f". Furthermore, in the comments below,
		      indicate that a + b > c, this cannot be true if it a + b < c, 
		      since if the sum of a+b can equal to c, this erro won't be caught.

	Test Case: 2 2 4, will give you a result of Isosceles obtuse triangle, where it should
		   have given an error output. Any input of a + b = c will give you this error.

2) Debug Testing for triangletype_err2.c

Line 52: else if(a==b) - This is the test for isosceles triangle if side a and b are equal.
			 But this file is missing the case for (b==c). This can be fixed
			 by adding another else if statement for (b==c) or by adding || (b==c).

	Test Case: 3 4 4, or any other input of c x x, where c < x. Entering 3 4 4 for me
		   gave me an output saying that it is a scalene acute triangle, which is
		   wrong.

3) Debug Testing for triangletype_err3.c

Line 170 & 177: (a*a + b*b < c*c - 1)
		(a*a + b*b > c*c + 1) - There should be a +/- 1 as this would cause some triangles
					that have obtuse/acute angle to be registered as right triangles.
					This can be fix by removing -1 and + 1 from the 2 cases.

	Test Case: 2 2 3, should give you an acute isosceles triangle. Or any other input of the format
		   x x y , where x < y will give you the same error result.

4) Debug Testing for triangletype_err4.c

Line 170: ( a*a + b*b + 2*a*b < c*c ) - There is an additional +2*a*b in the case for obtuse triangle.
					Having this extra addition will cause some obtuse triangle to
					register as right isosceles right triangle.

	Test Case: 4 4 6, is clearly an Isosceles obtuse triangle as 16 + 16 < 36. But it gave a false
		   output that states this triangle is an isosceles right triangle.

5) Global Debug Testing

Line 180(Roughly) for ALL files triangletype_err*.c

No case was available for isosceles right triangle. a^2 + b^2 = c^2 where a==b.
A solution would be to incude a math.h header of some sort and set the square root
of both sides of the equation to equal to each other, as for an isosceles right 
triangle, c will ALWAYS be an irrational number.
