1) TestingMatrix() function 100% satsfied. Template matrix class works as stated in the TestingMatrix() function.

2) Fixed a minor error with TestingMatrix(). Originally had no return type, gave it a return type of void.

3) To run the program type: "make all"
   Then run prog1: "./prog1"

   If the above fails, complie with g++ with the following command:
   g++ paing_* -o prog1.exe
   Then run it : "./prog1"
